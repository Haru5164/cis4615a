SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java problems
The Java rules and recommendations used in the SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for
Java are a work in progress and reflect the current thinking of the secure coding community.
Because this is a development website, many pages are incomplete or may contain errors.
Nonetheless, we will be using this for a baseline set of a total of 10 short programming
examples with known security deficiencies. There are 5 mandatory examples to be included
in your GitHub account and 5 user selected examples to be included in your GitHub account
to earn full credit for this assignment.
The Coding Standard consists of a set of rules which are defined as follows: Rules must
meet the following criteria:
• Violation of the guideline is likely to result in a defect that may adversely affect the
safety, reliability, or security of a system, for example, by introducing a security flaw
that may result in an exploitable vulnerability.
• The guideline does not rely on source code annotations or assumptions.
• Conformance to the guideline can be determined through automated analysis (either
static or dynamic), formal methods, or manual inspection techniques.
Rules are identified by the label rule, for example Rule 00. Input Validation and Data
Sanitization (IDS) as shown below.
Each rule has one to several examples. The examples selected for this exercise are specified
below.
